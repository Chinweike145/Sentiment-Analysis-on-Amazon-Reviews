# Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Reviews

This project performs **Sentiment Analysis** on a dataset of **Amazon product reviews** to determine whether a given review expresses a **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral** sentiment. It applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to clean, process, and classify review text using machine learning models.

## üß† What It Does

- Preprocesses raw Amazon review text (cleaning, tokenization, stop-word removal)
- Extracts features using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings
- Trains a classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or an LSTM)
- Predicts the sentiment label of new or unseen reviews
- Evaluates model performance with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix
- Visualizes key insights using charts

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Scikit-learn**, **NLTK**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**
- (Optional) **TensorFlow/Keras** or **PyTorch** for deep learning
- **Jupyter Notebook** for development and visualization


## üóÉÔ∏è Dataset

- Amazon reviews dataset (can be obtained from sources like Kaggle or public Amazon datasets)
